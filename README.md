Source code for a Movie Trailer website.
The purpose of this project is to build a Movie Trailer website where users can view my favorite movies and watch the trailers.
This Movie project consists of 3 Python 2.7.12 files that store a list of movie titles, as well as their respective box art imagery and trailer website.

The Movie class in the media.py file creates a data structure to store the movies, movie title,URL and YouTube link.

The entertainment_center.py file creates instances of that Movie class to represent the movies and groups them together.

fresh_tomatoes.py is the Phython module with the function open_movies_page which takes one argument, the list of movies and creates an HTML file displaying all the movies on a webpage.

FILES INCLUDED:
media.py
entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
